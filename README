captivednsd
-----------

captivednsd, the Captive Domain Name Server, returns same authorative response 
to every query. The reponse to 'A' queries and 'PTR' records are passed as 
a parameter on the command line. The code is covered by the GNU license.

I wrote the daemon to direct people to a captive web portal, on a system that 
was not connected to the Internet. This meant that it was not possible to 
resolve the correct IP address for a host and then redirect the query using a 
firewall.

captivednsd is based on the source code of scdns and Busybox's dnsd:
